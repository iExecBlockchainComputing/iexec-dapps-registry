# iexec dapp Betify

## DApp Description

A dapp build on top of iexec that allowed user to make bet that are absolutely transparent and provable fairness.

## Implementation Presentation

1. design an algorithm that will generate a true random number among DAPPs, the process is approved to be fair and agreed by all participants. This will involve some calculations and verifications for each participant.
2. build smart contract for each game mode.
3. front-end page for the dapp listing
4. dapp metrics page (history, user rank etc)

## Why is it built on Ethereum

Decentralization is the key to create a fair betting game, smart contract provide automation, transparent, provable fairness and verifiable game to all parties. Avoid human error and human influence.

## Why does it use iexec?

iexec's dapp store is the ideal platform for this DAPP to be listed and open to all users of iexec. Much easier to use and participate than a stand alone smart contract.
