## Description
image2speech is an Ethereum ready dapp that combines the functionalities of two other dapps: [image2text](https://github.com/Zied-Guesmi/image2text) and [text2speech](https://github.com/Zied-Guesmi/text2speech). It applies google's [tesseract-OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) engine to extract text from images and uses [mimic](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mimic) tts engine to convert text to speech and save them in wav format.
