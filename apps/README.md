* under the ```apps``` directory :
Put the offchain app (any kind of legacy application). The offchain app will be executed by the iExec decentralized cloud.

* under the ```contracts``` directory :
A smart contract that interfaces with your iExec Dapp, it will serve as a gateway from Ethereum to your offchain app.
