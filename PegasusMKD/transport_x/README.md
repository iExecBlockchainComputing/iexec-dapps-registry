### An iExec API for the Chainlink Hackathon

It's supposed to be used as a "Protocol" as in, ( later on when the app comes out, in a few days ) anyone can use the contract we made to build their own front-end to it which makes use of our system, AI, algorithm, etc.

If someone wants to make their own middleware, but use our API, they are free to do so. Or maybe someone would like to make their own API, and use our middleware, again, free to do so.

The API has 2 key features:

  - AI which predicts where users should be expected to call in the next hour, and sends taxi drivers to the location
  - Algorithm which finds the closest taxi ( from the given dataset ) to a user, and connects them, as well as sending the taxi to the user's location
  
Will add more documentation and stuff to the README in the next 3 days <3
